# Minecraft Mod Profiles
An app that manages minecraft mods by keeping track of "profiles".

## Installing
Download the `.zip` file from [the latest release](https://github.com/zeeshanok/minecraft-mod-profiles/releases/latest), extract it and run `mod_profiles.exe`

Or

Run:
```
cd mod_profiles
flutter build windows --release
```
and then run `mod_profiles/build/windows/runner/Release/mod_profiles.exe`
## Note
This app is meant to be run on Windows (though you can build it for other platforms).
It will break if you try it on any other operating system.
Windows might tell you "smartscreen protected your device" or something similar, this is because Microsoft has never seen my app and so smartscreen thinks it's malicious (it's not).
